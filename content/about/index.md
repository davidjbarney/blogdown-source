Hey! I'm David. 

I currently work at Burning Glass Technologies, where I manage labor market research. Previously, I was a survey researcher at WarnerMedia focused on consumer insights.

I earned my B.A. in Political Science from UMass Lowell, and my M.A. in Political Science from UMass Amherst. As a graduate student, I worked on the Cooperative Congressional Election Study.

Feel free to drop me a line!
